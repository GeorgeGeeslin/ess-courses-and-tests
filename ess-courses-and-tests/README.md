# Hello eStrategy Solutions

Here's my crud app and some basic instructions:

1.  Have mysql and sequelize cli installed.
2.  Peak on over at ess-courses-and-tests\config\config.json to see what schema, user, password etc.
3.  clone my app.
4.  cd to my app and run npm install.
5.  then run sequelize db:migrate
6.  npm run dev
